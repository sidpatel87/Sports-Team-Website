    <h1>About Us</h1>

    <p>
    Hello, I am Siddharth Patel, Masters candidate at USF in Business Analytics and Aritificial Inelligence. <br>

    I am a big fan of Philadelphia Eagles and wanted to create a fan page for the team. <br>

    This is my first attempt in building a HTML website. I created the site using basic HTML and CSS. I also included javascript using Chart.JS.
    I created a CRUD page to simulate merchandise purchase. I also created an analytics page to show the team record using Chart.JS. <br>
    I used online resources like W3Schools to learn about HTML, CSS and javascript. <br>
    Buiding this website has been a great experience for me. I learned about different html elements and how to format the website using CSS. <br>
    
    I am a pharmacist by profession and have been working in the field for over 10 years.
    I want to learn about business analytics and AI to enhance my career prospects and explore new opportunities.
    I would like to merge my healthcare experience with data analytics to make a positive impact in the industry.
    <br>Thank you for visiting my website!<br>
    <br>Fly Eagles Fly!
