Project Overview
This project is a static website created for Assignment 1 of the ISM 6225 course at the University of South Florida. The goal of this assignment was to build a multi-page website demonstrating fundamental web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and good user interface design. The assigned content theme for this project is "Sports Team," for which the Philadelphia Eagles were chosen.

The website serves as a simple fan hub, providing information about the team, a mock e-commerce interface for merchandise, and data analytics on team performance.

Features
This website includes four pages:

Home Page (index.html):

Provides a welcome message and a brief introduction to the Philadelphia Eagles.

Includes key facts about the team, such as their mascot and Super Bowl victories.

Merchandise Page (merchandise.html):

This page serves as the CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) component of the assignment.

It displays team merchandise and features a web-based form to "mock" the management of customer orders.

Create: A form to place a new order.

Read: A search form to look up an existing order by ID.

Update & Delete: Buttons to simulate updating or canceling a found order.

Analytics Page (record.html):

Displays a data table of the Eagles' season-by-season records from 2018-2025.

Features an interactive bar chart created with the Chart.js library, which visualizes the number of wins per season when a button is clicked.

About Us Page (aboutus.html):

Contains information about me, the student developer.

Describes the process of building this website and lists the technologies used.

Includes a direct link to this GitHub repository.

Technologies Used
HTML5: For the structure and content of the web pages.

CSS3: For all styling, including layout, colors, and fonts to create a consistent "Eagles Theme."

JavaScript: To provide interactivity on the analytics page.

Chart.js: A JavaScript library used to create the dynamic bar chart for data visualization.
